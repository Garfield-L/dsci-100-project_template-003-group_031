after writing the paragraph and learning the overview of data, lets focus on step 2.: 

as you said: Step 2: Data Description & Variable Summary
Create tables showing: variable names, types, descriptions

Calculate summary statistics: mean(), sd(), n(), etc.

Identify potential data issues: missing values, outliers, data types

Commit: "Complete data description and variable summary"

i want to add idea, that i want to be cleaning data, by using different functions, this is not ask you to play with data but get some important idea from data, while preparing for the broad question and the predictive question in step 3. dont forget the paragraph for this step, explaining your idea. for example, you should:
- clean the corresponding hashed emails from two files
- filter within age and experience..
etc
i need you to at least write 30 lines in total for this step
